I am a Master student in Germany. My current study mainly focuses on economics of education combining with extensive training in programming and innovative analysis methods. I have believed that economics is an exciting discipline in which people use mathematics and statistics as the primary language to model, observe and solve problems in society. Good development policies are expected to contribute to economic growth by removing constraints on each individual, allowing them to pursue their economic interests.

Many recent studies in human capital accumulation have focused on identifying how human capital develops from childhood through adolescence and into early adulthood to reduce inequalities by better understanding the mechanism driving gaps. I am focusing on two critical questions for my study: how public investments in human capital should be distributed among children from disadvantaged backgrounds to reduce inequality and how costly it is a late remedy for addressing early disadvantage.
